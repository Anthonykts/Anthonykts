## üìÇ Projects

### Flexible Demand in the European Day-Ahead Electricity Market  
Analysis of flexible demand in the European day-ahead electricity market. The model is **general and agnostic**, allowing **demand shifting across hours while maintaining total daily energy consumption**. Incorporates **flexibility parameters (Œ±), optional discomfort costs**, and **social welfare optimization**, providing insights into **market prices, generation schedules, and demand management strategies**.

### EU Market Clearing Price  
Market clearing and pricing for the Greek day-ahead electricity market (17/05/2024), following the **European Target Model**.  
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Anthonykts/EU-Market-Clearing-Model)

### DC Powerflow Model  
Python implementation of the **DC Power Flow model** for electricity market clearing and pricing, with Excel-based input/output.  
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Anthonykts/dc-powerflow-model)

### ATC (Available Transfer Capacity) Model  
Development of an **ATC calculation model** to assess available transfer capacity in transmission networks, supporting secure grid operation and electricity market transactions.  
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Anthonykts/atc-market-model)

### Unit Commitment  
Implementation of the **Unit Commitment problem** in power systems, formulated as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) and solved using Pyomo (small case) and Gurobi (main case).
